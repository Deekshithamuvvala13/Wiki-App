            <p>Apple Inc. (formerly Apple Computer, Inc.) is an American multinational corporation and technology
                company headquartered in Cupertino, California, in Silicon Valley. It designs, develops, and sells
                consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. Devices include the iPhone, iPad, Mac,
                Apple Watch, Vision Pro, and Apple TV; operating systems include iOS, iPadOS, and macOS; and software
                applications and services include iTunes, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.</p>
            <p>For most of 2011 to 2024, Apple became the world's largest company by market capitalization until
                Microsoft assumed the position in January 2024.[6][7] In 2022, Apple was the largest technology company
                by revenue, with US$394.3 billion.[8][failed verification] As of 2023, Apple was the fourth-largest
                personal computer vendor by unit sales,[9] the largest manufacturing company by revenue, and the largest
                vendor of mobile phones in the world.[10] It is one of the Big Five American information technology
                companies, alongside Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta (the parent company of
                Facebook), and Microsoft.Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, to produce and
                market Steve Wozniak's Apple I personal computer.</p> 
            <p>The company was incorporated by Wozniak and Steve Jobs
                in 1977. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced
                microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first
                computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, the company's internal problems
                included the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives. That year Jobs left Apple
                to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures. The market for personal computers expanded
                and evolved throughout the 1990s, and Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced Wintel
                duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones.</p>
